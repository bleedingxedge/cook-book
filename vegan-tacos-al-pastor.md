# Vegan Tacos al Pastor
My mom once had an urge to make us all stop eating red meat, and she came up with pretty awesome vegan-friendly recipes.

* Bring the water to a boil. Add the protein chunks and let it hydrate, when it's done hydrating add oregano, rosemary. Let it simmer in a boil for about three minutes. Rinse Thorougly.

* Cut the pineapple in strips, less than 1/2 inch in thickness should do. 

* Heat up a large skillet on hi-heat and add 1 tbsp. olive oil, add pineapple and fry about a minute on each side. Remove pineapple from the skillet and set aside. Add the protein chunks and let them dry a bit. 

* When they've reduced their size and have almost no water on them, reduce heat to medium and add the achiote paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add the rest of the olive oil and keep frying for about 10 to 15 minutes.

* Serve in warm corn tortillas with pineapple, coriander, onion and lime juice
