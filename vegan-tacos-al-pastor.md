# Vegan Tacos al Pastor
My mom once had an urge to make us all stop eating red meat, and she came up with pretty awesome vegan-friendly recipes.

## npm install
* 12 oz. of tofu (you can also use mushrooms or mixed veggies as replacement)
* 1/2 Pineapple
* 1/2 cup chopped white onion
* 1/2 cup chopped coriander
* 2 tbsp. Achiote paste (http://www.amazon.com/El-Yucateco-Achiote-Red-Paste/dp/B0000GHNV8)
* 1/2 cup orange juice
* 1/2 tsp. dry oregano
* 2 dry rosemary leaves
* 3 tbsp. olive oil
* Salt to taste
* Black Pepper to taste
* Corn Tortillas
* 3 to 4 limes

* Drain your tofu. Season. If using mixed veggies make sure to properly wash and dry them, then dice up in bite-size pieces and add a bit of salt. Add half cup of orange juice and let that reduce. Set aside.

* Cut the pineapple in strips, less than 1/2 inch in thickness should do. 

* Heat up a large skillet on hi-heat and add 1 tbsp. olive oil, add pineapple and fry about a minute on each side. Remove pineapple from the skillet and set aside. Add your tofu/vieggies and cook until done. Reduce heat to medium and add the achiote paste. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

* Serve in warm corn tortillas with pineapple, coriander, onion and lime juice.
