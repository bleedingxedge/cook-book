# Baked oatmeal
What it having cake for breakfast was suddenly healthy?
This can be just as good and it'll last for 4-5 days in your fridge.

## dependencies
* 1 1/2 cup oats (I like to use rolled oats but steel cut ones work pretty well too )
* 1 cup milk (whole, almond, rice, cashew, which ever you like best)
* 1 egg, small (for vegan or egg-free alternative you can use a mashed banana)
* 2 tablespoons honey (or maple syrup if you prefer)
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (or a vanilla bean if you're fancy)
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of cinnamon

### optional
* 1 tablespoon butter, room temperature
* 1/8 cup dark chocolate chips
* 1/8 cup chia seeds
* 1/4 cup mixed nuts
* 1/8 cup goji berries

## hardware
* a baking pan (I use a 12" seasoned cast iron skillet)
* oven, preheated at 195ÂºC
* two mixing bowls

## Install instructions
* In a bowl, mix the oats, chocolate chips, chia seeds, goji berries and mixed nuts. Set aside.
* In a separate bowl, mix the milk and butter until the butter is dissolved. Add egg (or banana) and mix well. Add the honey, cinnamon and salt. Mix again. 
* Slowly pour little by little the liquid mix to the oats mix and let rest for five minutes.
* On the meantime, butter your baking dish. 
* After five minutes, pour your oats and milk mix in your baking dish. Bake for 30-45 minutes or until set and golden brown.
* Let rest and cool for a few minutes before serving. (Serving with a bit of butter, honey, and fresh berries is my personal favorite.)
